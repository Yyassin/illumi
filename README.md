> A social desktop application made with students in mind. Illumi was designed to help simplify online-learning and the delivery of course content through a digital means. Students are grouped into servers corresponding to their enrolled courses, within which they are able to interact in real-time with their colleagues. Within each server, a catalog of course information, events, lessons, tutorials can be found along with optional real-time messaging rooms and a shared-user whiteboard.

### Running in Development

You will first need to clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Yyassin/illumi.git
```
* Install [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 12.x or later.

* Navigate to the appropriate directory from terminal:
```
cd ~/illumi
```

* Create a config folder under ```client/src``` with file ```keys.js``` within it. Here place your cloudinary bucket name for image uploads:
```
module.exports = {
    cloudURL: '<YOUR.CLOUDINARY.NAME>'
}
```


* Create another config folder under ```server``` with file ```keys.js``` within it. Here place your mongo URI for connection to the database and also an API key, to secure REST access:
```
module.exports = {
    api: {
        key: 'secret_string'
    },

    database: {
        uri: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<your-cluster-url>/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority`,
    },
}
```

* Install the required dependencies in both the server and client directories:
```
cd ~/illumi/client && npm i
cd ~/illumi/server && npm i
```
* Run the main client file, along with the backend server in seperate terminals:
```
cd ~/illumi/client && npm run dev
cd ~/illumi/server && npm run dev
```
### Documentation
Visit `localhost:5000/api` while the app is running for further app and API documentation. Alternatively, head over to the deployed site [here](http://illumi2.canadaeast.cloudapp.azure.com/).
  
* Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰

**Note** : The backend server is routinely turned off from 10 PM to 8 AM. The app will not function during these hours.
