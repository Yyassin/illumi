> **Illumi** is desktop social application made with students in mind. It was designed to help simplify online-learning and the delivery of course content through a digital means. Students are grouped into servers corresponding to their enrolled courses, within which they are able to interact in real-time with their colleagues. Within each server, a catalog of course information, events, lessons, tutorials can be found along with optional real-time messaging rooms and a shared-user whiteboard.
